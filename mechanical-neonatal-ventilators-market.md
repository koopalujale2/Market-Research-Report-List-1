<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical neonatal ventilators market is segmented into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive ventilators involve intubation, where a tube is inserted into the infant's airway to provide respiratory support, typically used for more severe cases. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver respiratory assistance without intubation, utilizing devices like CPAP or bi-level ventilation, beneficial for less critical conditions and reducing the risk of complications. Both types are essential in managing neonatal respiratory issues effectively.</p></p>
